# ECE361 TCP Chat

## Features
- Tagging: @username will be highlighted for the recipient (processed on the server for the sake of making it somewhat less trivial).
- Administration: (`/kick`, `/ban`, `/unban`,`/delete`, `/resign`): Session creator is initially assigned the administrative privileges and can use these special commands. `/leave`ing without `/resign`ing will result in the next oldest user being promoted to an administrator.

## Future Work
TLS
